Here is my Rideshare project. Somethings I am proud of are...
- Of starting the Car and Person classes pretty much on my own
- The formatting of the results that took awhile
- 


Based on the simulations (tried 5 times)...
(1)
If there are 40 cars and 50 passengers, 44.4% passengers will make it to their destination
    The 5 test results: (20/50 + 23/50 + 24/50 + 27/50 + 17/50)/5 * 100

(2)
If there are 20 cars and 50 passengers, 38.0% passengers will make it to their destination
    The 5 test results: (15/50 + 21/50 + 18/50 + 19/50 + 22/50)/5 * 100
